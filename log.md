# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 3, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Started work on the Tribute challenge from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Pushing myself a bit in this challenge to incorporate a div overlay with alpha transparency.

### Day 1: Jan 4, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS for the Tribute page, and incorporated a basic parallax scroll. Added all information elements. Ready to call this one DONE.

**Thoughts**: I feel really proud of myself. I haven't written code for over 6 years...it kind of feels like coming home!

**Today's Progress**: Repaired an issue with the footer on my tribute page. Commenced wireframing for the portfolio challenge.

**Thoughts**: This is great! I was abl to troubleshoot and fix an issue on my page with the footer. Learnt a lot about absolute and relative positioning.

### Day 3: Jan 6, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Completed wireframing for the portfolio challenge. Skeleton of the page has been set up...somewhat.

**Thoughts**: I've definitely got to read more on Bootstrap. There are many handy tools there for managing and styling nav bars which I think is one of the major learning points in the challenge. Will be testing out a few things.
