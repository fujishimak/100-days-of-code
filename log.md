# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 3, 2016 (Example 1)


**Today's Progress**: Started work on the Tribute challenge from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Pushing myself a bit in this challenge to incorporate a div overlay with alpha transparency.

### Day 1: Jan 4, 2016


**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS for the Tribute page, and incorporated a basic parallax scroll. Added all information elements. Ready to call this one DONE.

**Thoughts**: I feel really proud of myself. I haven't written code for over 6 years...it kind of feels like coming home!
